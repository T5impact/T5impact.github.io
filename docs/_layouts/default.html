                                            Welcome to the underworld, or what is becoming the bridge between our world and the one below. This is Pac’s Revenge, a classic FPS game with collection mechanics hosting some sweet retro graphics. Hoping to recapture that classic retro style, Pac’s Revenge takes great inspiration from the legendary 1993 Doom with its custom-made grotesque graphics, FPS elements, and, of course, an intense heavy soundtrack. Your world is getting taken over by a dark evil, and you need to fight back. Will you succeed in saving your world, or will you fall into demonic corruption?

                                    <b>My role</b> was Team Lead, Programmer, and Artist/Technical Artist. I programmed the enemy AI, player inventory, player shooting, level progression, player stats, and other systems. To achieve the retro visual aesthetic, I programmed many full-screen and post-processing shaders. I created a fog shader that gradually gets more and more opaque at integral steps. I also created all of the 2D and 3D art seen in the game and designed all of the characters.

                                            Humanity is on the brink of collapse. You are the last known web diver in the world. You must travel back to the year 1999 using the last remaining time bubble. Use your web diving skills to stop the virus before it has the chance to eradicate the world. W3B D1V3R is a 2D Vampire Survivor-like with an endless mode where your goal is to get as powerful as possible. This game was created for the 2025 Global Game Jam and developed in 48 hours.

The weapons and passives system was designed to be easily expandable and modular for further development. I also implemented a lot of the art and created some of the extra assets we needed as well.

                    Welcome to the underworld, or what is becoming the bridge between our world and the one below. This is Pac’s Revenge, a classic FPS game with collection mechanics hosting some sweet retro graphics. Hoping to recapture that classic retro style, Pac’s Revenge takes great inspiration from the legendary 1993 Doom with its custom-made grotesque graphics, FPS elements, and, of course, an intense heavy soundtrack. Your world is getting taken over by a dark evil, and you need to fight back. Will you succeed in saving your world, or will you fall into demonic corruption?

                    <b>My role</b> was Team Lead, Programmer, and Artist/Technical Artist. I programmed the enemy AI, player inventory, player shooting, level progression, player stats, and other systems. To achieve the retro visual aesthetic, I programmed many full-screen and post-processing shaders. I created a fog shader that gradually gets more and more opaque at integral steps. I also created all of the 2D and 3D art seen in the game and designed all of the characters.

                    I created a volumetric cloud rendering shader. The shader is a raymarcher that samples a pseudo-randomly generated, tilable, 3D Worley noise. This type of noise was chosen because of its tendency to create billowing shapes. The clouds are blitted to the screen in a single pass as part of a post-processing effect. I plan to add further optimizations to the shader and integrate it with my atmospheric scattering shader.

                    I developed a high performant atmospheric scattering shader for creating realistic looking planetary atmospheres. This shader is a volumetric raymarcher that samples an inverse exponential function. The shader is optimized by pre-calculating an optical depth texture per planet and sampling that texture. I plan to add further optimizations and tools to easily generate new planet atmospheres.

                    I developed an implementation of the Cubical Marching Squares algorithm using it for generating terrain. The algorithm was implemented in parallel on the GPU using compute shaders with integration to an Octree allowing for varying levels-of-detail (LODs) in the mesh generation. The Octree creation algorithm was designed in parallel on the GPU using the fundamentals of a parallel merge sort. The Octree is stored in a 3D texture for access during the CMS algorithm.
