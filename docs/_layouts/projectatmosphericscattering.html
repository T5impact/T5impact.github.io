    <h1>GPU Terrain Generation</h1>

  <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores real-time terrain generation using the
      Cubical Marching Squares (CMS) algorithm sampled from a dynamically
      generated Octree. The entire pipeline—data generation, spatial
      subdivision, and mesh construction—runs in parallel on the GPU.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Problem Statement ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional Marching Cubes struggles with sharp feature preservation
      and does not integrate cleanly with variable level-of-detail systems.
      Additionally, recursive spatial data structures such as Octrees are
      inherently difficult to generate efficiently in a parallel GPU context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to design a GPU-friendly terrain pipeline
      that supports adaptive LOD while preserving surface features and
      remaining performant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== High-Level Architecture ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>High-Level Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate Hermite density and normal data using layered 3D noise</li>
      <li>Construct an Octree entirely on the GPU via compute shaders</li>
      <li>Store Octree data in a 3D texture for random-access sampling</li>
      <li>Apply Cubical Marching Squares to generate mesh geometry</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Octree Generation ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Parallel Octree Generation</h2>
    <p>
      Because recursive subdivision introduces race conditions in parallel
      environments, the Octree is generated in reverse: starting at maximum
      subdivision and progressively un-subdividing nodes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Octree construction implemented entirely on the GPU</li>
      <li>Custom node metadata generated using parallel merge-style passes</li>
      <li>Local GPU memory used to minimize synchronization overhead</li>
      <li>Efficiency decreases as nodes are un-subdivided, a known tradeoff</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== CMS Algorithm ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Cubical Marching Squares</h2>
    <p>
      CMS decomposes the 3D meshing problem into six 2D Marching Squares passes
      per cube, allowing improved feature preservation and compatibility with
      variable LOD.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Preserves sharp surface features better than Marching Cubes</li>
      <li>Enables integration with adaptive Octree subdivision</li>
      <li>Transition faces between LODs present the primary complexity</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Technical Challenges ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Resolving transition faces between neighboring Octree nodes of
        differing subdivision levels
      </li>
      <li>
        Preventing non-manifold geometry during mesh regeneration
      </li>
      <li>
        Balancing GPU parallelism against memory coherence and access patterns
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Performance Considerations ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All major stages execute on the GPU to minimize CPU-GPU transfers</li>
      <li>Octree data stored in a 3D texture for cache-friendly access</li>
      <li>Parallel execution maximized during initial subdivision stages</li>
      <li>Known inefficiencies emerge during late-stage un-subdivision</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Results & Limitations ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Results & Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      The system successfully generates airtight meshes with variable LOD on
      initial execution. However, repeated regeneration can introduce holes
      at LOD transition boundaries, indicating unresolved edge cases in the
      transition-face logic.
