  <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores real-time procedural terrain generation capable of supporting caves, 
      overhangs, and variable level-of-detail (LOD), which is a combination not well supported by 
      common real-time terrain solutions. Most existing approaches rely on single-resolution grids, 
      making them unsuitable for large-scale environments such as planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this research was to investigate a GPU-driven approach that could scale terrain detail 
      dynamically based on distance from the camera, enabling large, seamless planetary terrain suitable 
      for real-time gameplay.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Problem Statement ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Popular real-time terrain generation algorithms, like Marching Cubes, that support volumetric features 
      (such as caves and overhangs) typically operate on uniform-resolution grids, preventing detail from 
      falling off with distance. This severely limits scalability for large environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project investigates an approach that supports variable LOD while maintaining real-time performance, 
      with the long-term goal of enabling procedural planet generation.

    <ul>
      <li>Research-focused prototype developed as an extended academic assignment</li>
      <li>Designed for real-time generation and editing, not offline baking</li>
      <li>Intended as a foundation for a future game project involving large procedural planets</li>

  <!-- ===== High-Level Architecture ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>High-Level Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The terrain generation pipeline is entirely GPU-driven after initial setup:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Hermite Data Generation</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compute shader calculates Hermite data for the volumetric field</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Octree Construction on the GPU</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A compute shader constructs an octree from the Hermite data</li>
      <li>Uses techniques inspired by parallel merge sort to avoid pure recursion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Mesh Generation</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A compute shader traverses the octree and Hermite data</li>
      <li>Generates triangle meshes using Cubical Marching Squares</li>
      <li>Resolves ambiguities and handles resolution transitions between LOD levels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Rendering & Physics</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generated mesh is rendered directly in the scene</li>
      <li>Colliders are generated automatically from the output geometry</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== GPU-Specific Design Decisions ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>GPU-Specific Design Decisions</h2>
    <h3>GPU-Based Octree Construction</h3>
    <p>
      The primary technical challenge was generating an octree on the GPU, as recursive data 
      structures are poorly suited to GPU architectures.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial CPU-based octree construction was too slow for real-time use</li>
      <li>Refactored the process to run entirely on the GPU</li>
      <li>Emulated recursive behavior using parallel-friendly techniques inspired by merge sort</li>
      <li>Leveraged GPU execution groups and shared local memory to coordinate octree construction efficiently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach avoided pure recursion entirely while preserving the hierarchical structure needed for variable LOD.
    </p>
