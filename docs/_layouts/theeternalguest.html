  <!-- ===== Project Overview ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Eternal Guest is a narrative-driven exploration game set within a mysterious 
      hotel where rooms shift and reconfigure over time. The project focused heavily on modular 
      player systems, systemic progression, and tightly integrated combat, inventory, and ability 
      frameworks that could support a wide variety of playstyles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I served as the primary gameplay programmer and team lead, owning the majority of player-facing 
      systems, enemy and boss AI behavior, and multiple core refactors driven by playtesting feedback. 
      I also contributed significantly to the game’s visual presentation through custom shaders, VFX, and UI design.

  <!-- ===== Responsibilities ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>My Role & Ownership</h2>
    <h3>Primary Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary gameplay programmer responsible for player systems and progression</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented inventory, combat, ability, and item architectures</li>
      <li>Refactored the randomized exploration system based on playtest feedback</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented base enemy navigation and all boss AI encounters</li>
      <li>Integrated gameplay systems with save/load functionality</li>
      <li>Created approximately half of the game’s art assets</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented UI and pixelated visual effects</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Key Systems ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Key Systems I Built</h2>

    <h3>Tri-Inventory System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and implemented an inventory system supporting items, weapons, and abilities</li>
      <li>Integrated inventory data directly into combat, abilities, and player stats</li>
      <li>Served as the backbone for player progression and build customization</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modular Melee Combat System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a polymorphic melee weapon framework</li>
      <li>Enabled unique attack behaviors while sharing common interfaces</li>
      <li>Fully integrated with inventory and player stats systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modular Ability System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a prefab-driven, polymorphic ability architecture</li>
      <li>Allowed abilities to encapsulate behavior, visuals, and effects</li>
      <li>Abilities are instantiated dynamically when equipped, enabling rapid content expansion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modular Item System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented a polymorphic item framework supporting unique behaviors per item</li>
      <li>Integrated with inventory and player stat modifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Player Stats & Effects System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a stats system supporting damage modifiers, attack speed, and DOT effects</li>
      <li>Unified stats across weapons, abilities, and items for consistent scaling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Refactored Randomized Exploration System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Refactored an existing non-Euclidean exploration system</li>
      <li>Preserved the intended “shifting labyrinth” feel while improving player orientation</li>
      <li>Introduced controlled randomness and periodic layout resets to balance confusion and clarity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enemy AI Navigation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented a context-aware navigation system without traditional pathfinding</li>
      <li>Enabled flexible room creation and easy map expansion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Boss AI State Machines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed custom multi-phase state machines for each boss encounter</li>
      <li>Integrated dialogue-driven cutscenes between phases</li>
      <li>Supported behavior variation based on dialogue outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inventory Save/Load Integration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assisted in integrating inventory and progression data with the save/load system</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pixelated VFX & Shaders</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Created custom pixelated shaders and particle effects</li>
      <li>Used for abilities, combat feedback, and environmental effects</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- ===== Technical Challenges ===== -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <h3>Refactoring Exploration Without Breaking Design Intent</h3>
    <p>
      Playtesting revealed that the original fully random layout caused excessive disorientation. I 
      led a refactor that introduced consistent structural generation with a probabilistic chance for 
      doors to desynchronize, paired with periodic layout resets. This maintained the non-Euclidean 
      theme while improving player comprehension and flow.
    </p>

    <h3>Designing Scalable Ability Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      To support a wide variety of abilities with unique behaviors and visuals, I designed a 
      prefab-based polymorphic system where each ability encapsulates its logic and presentation. 
      This allowed new abilities to be added with minimal engineering overhead and no changes to 
      core player logic.
